📘 Predictive Question Paper Generator

A machine learning project built using Python and Scikit-learn to analyze historical exam papers and predict high-probability questions for future exams.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Analyzes question recurrence patterns using regression to generate predicted question papers with ~80% accuracy. Enabled GPA improvement from 7.15 to 8.15.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter, Linear Regression

## 📂 Structure
- `data/` - Past paper CSV
- `src/` - Modular code (preprocessing, training, generation)
- `notebooks/` - Model walkthrough
- `outputs/` - Generated papers, metrics

## ▶️ Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-question-paper-generator.git
cd predictive-question-paper-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebooks/model-development.ipynb
